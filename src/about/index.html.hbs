    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>My name is <a href="#not-ready">Maxime Thirouin</a>, also known as <a href="https://github.com/MoOx">MoOx</a>, and I'm a french (front-end) web developer living in Toulouse, France.</p>

    <p>
      I like to work on the client-side, designing interfaces with <strong>CSS</strong> (using pre|post-processor like Sass or Rework) and programming awesome experiences with <strong>JavaScript</strong>. But I also do some back-end when it's needed no matter what the language is.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also like to share everything I learned: I enjoy giving some talks and I'm a <strong>teacher</strong> in my previous University.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside that, I like to enjoy time with the love of my live, create stuff with my hands, take a walk in the forest or play paintball with my friends.
    </p>
