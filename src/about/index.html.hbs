    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>My name is <a href="#not-ready">Maxime Thirouin</a>, also known as <a href="https://github.com/MoOx">MoOx</a>, and I'm a french web developer living in Toulouse, France.</p>

    <p>
      <strong class="text--light">I like to work on the client-side, designing interfaces with CSS (using pre-processor like Sass with Compass) and programming awesome experiences with JavaScript. But I also do some back-end when it's needed no matter what the language is.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I also like to share everything I learned: I enjoy giving some talks and I'm a teacher in my previous University.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside that, I like to enjoy time with the love of my live, create stuff with my hands, take a walk in the forest or play paintball with my friends.
    </p>
