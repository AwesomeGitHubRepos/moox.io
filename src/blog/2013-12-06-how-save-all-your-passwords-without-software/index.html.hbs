## What wrong with password softwares ?

You have one password to unlock them all. That's it.

## So what your solution ? A piece of paper ?

Naaa. My mind. I know what your are thinking right now: "This guy is just stupid, it's impossible".
Or maybe "I don't have the required brain for that". Oh yes you do.

First of all read this [nice strip](https://xkcd.com/936/).
You are welcome. The main idea is in that strip.

Now here is what I've done: I've choosed 4 "base" passwords.

* One long & strong with multiples special chars, numbers & letter;
* One shorter between 8 & 20 chars, just letter & numbers (for shitty website you know);
* Two really short & shitty passwords (one with 6 letters, one with 4 numbers).

### How to build my password so I can remember them easily ?

#### The secure one

Super easy. Just choose a phrase, & write it converting some phonetical things to number, & adding some special chars.

Just-Wr0te-Something-1337,mofo!

I thing this is a fucking great example of a simple password. Don't make it over size too.

#### Less secure password

For this one, you can just use a word you like a lot, & apply the rules below.

0h_Fuck_Y34h

#### Shitty password with letters

Choose an custom word you invent when you where young with your friends like a funny barbarism.

#### Shitty password with numbers

Simple. Choose a date. But not a birthday or something public. Just choose a date that mean a lot to you, for example the date where you bought your first Apple II.

Now you have 4 "base" passwords. Eventually you can choose less base. It's your call.

#### Give me the salt please

To add some salt to your 2 first bases (the last ones are for really shitty website you are forced to useâ€¦), just choose a simple algorithm to create your own. For example, I just add a combination of 2 special chars & some stuff depending on the website name (eg: 2nd & last letter).

### Note

I change this 4 bases every year or every 6 months, & try to update asap on all website I go.

## Alternative solution

Use `Forgot your password` link all the time.
Some people do that.
